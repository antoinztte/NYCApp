# Sociable

During the pandemic, our social lives were disrupted, leading to increased feelings of loneliness. For city teens, it was difficult and overwhelming to meet with and befriend others of our age (especially because the city is HUGE and DIVERSE). Our app, made BY teens FOR teens, serves as a social platform for the youth of New York City. For anyone (including tourists AND natives) looking to explore the city with a friend and form lasting friendships across the five boroughs, our app is for you! 

We incorporated a navigation toolbar with multiple pages for chatting, viewing updates in the city, and exploring using a map! Beyond our MVP (minimum viable product), we hope to design the app to become more interactive and truly user-friendly. Stay tuned for updates! Until then - stay sociable :)
